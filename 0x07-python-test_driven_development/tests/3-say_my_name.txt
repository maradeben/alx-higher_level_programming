Tests for the ``say_my_name`` function
========================================

    >>> say_my_name = __import__("3-say_my_name").say_my_name

Example:
    Test case with two correct strings:
    >>> say_my_name("John", "Smith")
    My name is John Smith

    Test case with first_name as int
    >>> say_my_name(4, "Smith")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: first_name must be a string

    Test case with last_name as int
    >>> say_my_name("John", 4)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: last_name must be a string

    Test case with both as int
    >>> say_my_name(4, 4)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: first_name must be a string

    Test case with only first_name argument
    >>> say_my_name("Bob")
    My name is Bob 

    Test case with empty string as first_name
    >>> say_my_name("")
    My name is  

    Test case with more than two arguments
    >>> say_my_name("First", "Middle", "Last")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: say_my_name() takes from 1 to 2 positional arguments but 3 were given

    Test case with four arguments
    >>> say_my_name("First", "Middle", "Last", "Extra")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: say_my_name() takes from 1 to 2 positional arguments but 4 were given

    Test case with undefined value
    >>> say_my_name(a_name)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    NameError: name 'a_name' is not defined

    Test case with undefined value
    >>> say_my_name("Bob", a_name)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    NameError: name 'a_name' is not defined

    Test case with extra variable that's undefined
